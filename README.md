# Intention
1. The server side part of this application it's kind of proxy that leverage the MELI response with new fields and clear some other.
2. The client side part is the application that request to 1 and show user information.

# Notes
I want to use the new features of ES both server side and client side, so I use babel to transpile code.

I use webpack to bundle and handle most of the "magic" things
